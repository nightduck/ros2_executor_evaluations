# Development Setup

If you want to develop in this repository, it has been setup for Docker+VSCode integration. You should already have Docker and VSCode with the remote containers plugin installed on your system.

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [vscode remote containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)


When you open it for the first time, you should see a little popup that asks you if you would like to open it in a container.  Say yes!

If you don't see the pop-up, click on the little green square in the bottom left corner, which should bring up the container dialog

In the dialog, select "Remote Containers: Reopen in container"

VSCode will build the dockerfile inside of `.devcontainer` for you.  If you open a terminal inside VSCode (Terminal->New Terminal), you should see that your username has been changed to `ros`, and the bottom left green corner should say "Dev Container"

Finally, you should setup your environment. Do this with Ctrl+Shift+P, "Run Task", and "Setup". This will run the `setup.sh` script, which installs dependencies and downloads all submodules.

# Setup for Experiments

To recreate the experiments in the paper, clone this repository onto a Raspberry Pi Model 4B with

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:nightduck/rtss2024_paper.git

Configure your Pi with the following

    cd reference-system
    sudo su
    configure_pi.sh

This will prompt you to reboot your Pi. Do so. After lauching, run

    ./build.sh

This will take several minutes (because cross compilation for ROS2 requires arm64 emulation which
is ironically slower than just compiling on the Pi itself).

# Experiments

There are 4 experiments to run in this repository. To run the first 3, execute:

    source install/setup.bash
    sudo ./timers_only_benchmark_uniprocessor.sh    # Timers only experiment
    sudo ./sequences_benchmark_uniprocessor.sh      # Chain sequences experiment
    ./autoware_benchmark.sh                         # Autoware benchmark

All the produced data will be stored in the `data` directory. Copy this directory to your local
machine to run the Jupyter notebook, `process_evaluation_data.ipynb`.

With the default times, these three commands will take a few minutes to run. For extended times,
like found in the paper, edit the `duration` variable in each script to a higher value (we used 600
in the paper). This will take several hours.

## FAQ

### WSL2

#### The gui doesn't show up

This is likely because the DISPLAY environment variable is not getting set properly.

1. Find out what your DISPLAY variable should be

      In your WSL2 Ubuntu instance

      ```
      echo $DISPLAY
      ```

2. Copy that value into the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file

      ```jsonc
      	"containerEnv": {
		      "DISPLAY": ":0",
         }
      ```

#### I want to use vGPU

If you want to access the vGPU through WSL2, you'll need to add additional components to the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in accordance to [these directions](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/blob/main/samples/container/Containers.md)

```jsonc
	"runArgs": [
		"--network=host",
		"--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE",
		"--security-opt=seccomp:unconfined",
		"--security-opt=apparmor:unconfined",
		"--volume=/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix",
		"--volume=/mnt/wslg:/mnt/wslg",
		"--volume=/usr/lib/wsl:/usr/lib/wsl",
		"--device=/dev/dxg",
      		"--gpus=all"
	],
	"containerEnv": {
		"DISPLAY": "${localEnv:DISPLAY}", // Needed for GUI try ":0" for windows
		"WAYLAND_DISPLAY": "${localEnv:WAYLAND_DISPLAY}",
		"XDG_RUNTIME_DIR": "${localEnv:XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}",
		"PULSE_SERVER": "${localEnv:PULSE_SERVER}",
		"LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/usr/lib/wsl/lib",
		"LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE": "1" // Needed for software rendering of opengl
	},
```

### Repos are not showing up in VS Code source control

This is likely because vscode doesn't necessarily know about other repositories unless you've added them directly. 

```
File->Add Folder To Workspace
```

Or you've added them as a git submodule.

To add all of the repos in your *.repos file, run the script

```bash
python3 .devcontainer/repos_to_submodules.py
```

or run the task titled `add submodules from .repos`
